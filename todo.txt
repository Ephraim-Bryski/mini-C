what i have so far
    comments
    #include (checks circular dependencies)
    branches (if)
    loops (for and while) with continue and break
    functions with parameters and return statements, supports recursion
    nested blocks
    nested expressions
    arithmetic and logical operators
    variable and global scope (declaration vs. assignment)
    types (int, char, structs, and arbitrary pointer levels), strict type checking, and type casting
    array and string literals
    nested data structures (AoA, SoA, AoS)
    intrinsics: sizeof, and my own made up ones (_print_int, _print_char, _halt)
    error(message), this is not in C, just prints the error and terminates execution
    libraries:
        strings: length, print string etc.
        memory allocator
        dynamic arrays that use the memory allocator
    
things i'll deal with later (maybe)
    <random characters> <variable>; doesnt return an error
    allows functions and variables to share the same name
        is it reallyyy a problem though
    int a = 255+2 will equal 1
        each of them are less than 256, so i make them both 8bit (char)
        adding them together is then 8bit too, so overflows
    assumes that a leaf starting in open parentheses is a type cast
        e.g. (array)[0]
    hack at the end for the tester only works if main outputs char
        a bit hard to deal with cause i wouldn't know if it's an int or char in the tester
            could just always return intsS
    mypy errors
        token properties
        None flags, probably will just keep
        allocatetostack, string or None for variable name
        global syntax tree
        structfieldsize for getleafasm is None
        function indirection for getting asm
        globalsyntaxtree not defined
    refactor
        same way of dividing parsing and asm generation into functions (i.e. line vs. block vs different types of blocks)


change target to 6502 assembly
    write an assembler too?

future things to add
    enums and maybe unions
    signed integers
    cleaner error messages
        get line in source code

bootstrap??
